pip3 install gym
pip3 install keras
pip3 install tensorflow
pip3 install jupyter (if you have no IDE, you can also download pycharm)

Download this repository

If you use jupyter, navigate to the downloaded files with cd, just like with creating the virtual environment

Enter:
jupyter notebook

create a new notebook and copy the python file content to that notebook

If you use an IDE instead of jupyter, set your IDE to use the venv, and open the python scripts as they are.
